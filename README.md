# a-math-question
a funny math question in my CS class
the question is this：
Find the number of primes within ten million,and then print out such fingers which satisfies two conditions:1,Is a 7-bit prime number 2.Only one digit is different from the other bits。  But the whole program has two requirements：1，Running time is less than 5 seconds. 2,Memory usage is no more than 4 megabytes. 

I have completed all the requirements of this process，But I do not think it succeeded.Can you give me a better program?
